# ApocryphonLoader 

This app is made to show the jewelry designers and artist how we can simply use ThreeJS to demonstrate a jewelry art to customers in web.  

As a demo model this scene uses a customised 3d model of ring called 'Apocryphon' by russian jewelry designer Styx Jewel (look through his site for more info:  https://styxjewel.com). 

The original stl-model consist of geometry is a property of the jeweler. But here in this app I used a gltf-model wich was made with a few time-consuming steps such as retopology and shading in ZBrush and Blender. Also this Gltf model created using texture-maps of metal from ambientCG.com, licensed under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal License.
